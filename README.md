# Memory Game

This is project number 2 of the udacity frontend nano degree program.

## Game functionality

At start, the game gives you _half_ a second to memorize the cards and their positions. For each move, you click on 2 cards and you lose a star when the cards do not match. The game runs out when all 3 stars are exhausted.
